This program was to introduce me to handling exception.
This program is a website tester to show the differnt things about the website.
It will show the size, download time, port, and host. The timeout section sets the time to wait until the website is downlaoded and accessed.
If it takes longer than timeout an exception will be thrown and then caught. Then shows the content of the website.
